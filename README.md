# UFOs

## Overview of Project 
I am helping Dana enhance her webpage by adding a few more filters to the exisitng date filter - this will make her webpage more user-friendly so that users can filter the UFO realted data more efficiently. With the help of JavaScript and its functionality this task is relatively easy to achieve. 
## Results
By adding more filter options we can customize our search in a way that our users will get the data they acyually need. Not only will it save their time (no need to scroll through so much) but it will also help them analyze their data in a more efficient way, which will allow to identify various patterns of UFO behaviour that would otherwise go unntocied. The interface of our website is intuitive so it shouldn't be diffcilut to use. By selecting your target date, city, state, country and shape you will get the information that matches your search criteria. 
## Summary
In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
