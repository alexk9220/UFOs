# UFOs

## Overview of Project 
I am helping Dana enhance her webpage by adding a few more filters to the exisitng date filter - this will make her webpage more user-friendly so that users can filter the UFO realted data more efficiently. With the help of JavaScript and its functionality this task is relatively easy to achieve. 

## Results
By adding more filter options we can customize our search in a way that our users will get the data they acyually need. Not only will it save their time (no need to scroll through so much) but it will also help them analyze their data in a more efficient way, which will allow to identify various patterns of UFO behaviour that would otherwise go unntocied. The interface of our website is intuitive so it shouldn't be diffcilut to use. By selecting your target date, city, state, country and shape you will get the information that matches your search criteria. 

Below are two examples of how our search functions work for the city of El Cajon in California.

## Summary
Our new website design definitely lets the users customize their search results and makes it easier for them to navigate the UFO data we have. While our filters can undoubtedly be useful to filter our dataset by state/city/country and date, the shape filter option seems unnecessary. Even though we can filter our data by shape, I can't see any analytical sense in doing that - there aren't too many shape options avaiable to begin with and it's also one of those additional parameters that can be ommitted.  
On the other hand, we can also make our website a little better by adding duration as our search criteria. While exact values will probably be not so useful, we might have time increments instead - let's say up to 6 min, 6 to 12 min, over 12 min, etc. 
I would aslo make our background a little darker - closer to black so that the white text that we have is in sharper contrast with the background that makes it more appealing aesthetically and easier to read.
